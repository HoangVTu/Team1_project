With having users trust our application to store information that they hold vital to them, which mean we are taking on the responsibility of keeping their informations private. 
We are simply providing a service and through that we don’t take consumer data or sell their information. 
We believe that digital services have the responsibility to be transparent with their customers and not sell their users information. 
With a degree of trust that the internet comes with everything that humans do rely on trust. Trust that a currency will sustain itself within an economy, 
trust in a government and its protection for its citizens and best interests. The internet is still seemingly unregulated and there are many gray areas thus creating applications that have the consumer’s best interests in mind will develop the safest and best product for them. 

The global impact we have is that since our application is digital, anyone in the world can access our application making and the economic impact is 
that our app can help improve productivity and allowing consumers to remember their important information in our notes application. 
Our environmental impact is our greatest feature due to the replacement of paper and trees being cut down simply to record data thus reducing waste and ecological footprint. 
And our societal impact is that we can allow people to transform their paper process of taking notes into a digital one.
